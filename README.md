# Health Bar Spigot Plugin
Plugin Developed by RainyPaws

The official repository for this plugin is https://github.com/bernieshan/HealthBar

I use IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 for development

Plugin is developed using Java JDK 1.8.0_261

Currently this plugin has only been tested on 1.16.1. There is no guarantee that the plugin will work on any other versions.

## Features ##
- Plugin adds Health Bars above the head of all mobs (excluding bosses)
- Health bars will only show when you are within range of the mob (like a normal name tag). This is to ensure that name tags cannot be used to find caves and see mobs through walls.
- Plugin is idea for a survival type server where there are no custom mobs
- Health Bars gives survival a semi-modded experience where it is still survival but with some extra features

### Planned Updates ###
- Add a feature that allows toggling plugin on and off

#### Extra Notes ####
Since this is my first plugin on Spigot, It would be extremely helpful if people gave their suggestions/opinions regarding this plugin. This will help me improve the existing features as well as create new features for this plugin.

If you have any suggestions for this plugin or any ideas for future plugins, please let me know as I am open to all suggestions.

However, I am not accepting any prewritten contributions to my code as I wish to have everything written by me.

Feel free to take this plugin and do whatever you want with it to fit your needs for your own servers. If you do use any part of this plugin in your own code, it would be appreciated if you credited this plugin in your plugin.
